# NC-News Front-end project

Welcome to NC News - a news app dedicated to delivering information on a variety of topics.
It consists of a front-end APP for a news system similar to Reddit, where users can post comments on the articles. Articles can receive positive and negative votes from users, depending on whether they liked the content or not.

The project was created with JavaScript (Node.js), React.js, MUI, and axios.

A live-hosted version of this project can be found at: - [NC-News](https://nc-news-fe-anna.netlify.app/)

You can find the back-end version for this project at Github:  [NC-News-API-repo](https://github.com/AnyaVeselova/be-nc-news) - Live Version:  [NC-News-BE-LIVE](https://nc-news-x69l.onrender.com/api)

Just to let you know, since this project is hosted at the free tier of Netlify, the server spins down if it stays inactive for a while. Please allow up to a minute to load the website for the first time. Every other interaction with the system after that should be instantly rendered.
